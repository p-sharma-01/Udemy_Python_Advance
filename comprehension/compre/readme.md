## Dictionary Comprehension
This is somehow hard to solve
# Instructions
Take a look inside files <b>file1.txt</b> and <b>file2.txt</b>. They have few numbers, each number in a new line.

You are going to create a new list called <b>result</b> which contains numbers common in both files.

e.g., file1.txt has numbers
<pre>
1
2
3
</pre>
and file2.txt has numbers
<pre>
2
3
4
</pre>
<pre>result = [2,3]</pre>

<B>Important: </b> The result should be a list contains <b>Integers </b> instead of <b>Strings </b>

## Example Output
<pre>[3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7]</pre>
#### Hint
1. Use the keyword method for starting the Dictionary Comprehension and fill in relevant parts.
2. First, you need to read files and create a list using lines in files.
